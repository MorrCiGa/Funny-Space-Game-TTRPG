In the non-physical plan there exist beings, which can be broken down into three categories, tenants, staff, arbiters

Tenants: 
	Tenants are beings which control a physical realm, they are very powerful beings who can shape the physical to their will, some are very hands on others are not. Tenants can be demoted to staff or promoted from staff if an arbiter deems it appropriate.

Staff:
	Staff are the extra planner beings who get stuff done, they are the grunts to the tenants, doing what is needed to keep this little starch of physical space kicking so the tenant can keep doing what they are doing. They are the only rank allowed to enter the physical realm.

Arbiter:
	An arbiter is a manifestation of the laws of the universe, they may or may not be a sentient being, but they are tasked with maintaining the function of things.
