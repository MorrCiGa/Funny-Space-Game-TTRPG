Magic, spell casting and the like is an integral part to this world, in the medieval era of this world it might be seen as a run of the mill fantasy world. Thus, magic is nothing new to this world, people integrate it into anything and everything at this point.

There are countless magical disciplines, different theories as to how it works and such, but fundamentally there are three basic rules to how magic functions.
1: The law of conservation: Magic can not just generate free energy, it can harness energy that exists and freely control it, but not create something from nothing.

2: Magic is deeply associated with the ethereal plane, the dreaming plane, or the outer realms, it is a connection between the realm of thought and mind to the realm of matter and reality.

3: A mind makes magic easier, but it is not required: Just like some elements are more conductive to electricity so to are some more conductive and or conducive to allow magic to flow and if pure enough may spontaneously cause magic to occur
