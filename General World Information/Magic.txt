Magic, spell casting and the like is an integral part to this world, in the medieval era of this world it might be seen as a run of the mill fantasy world. Thus, magic is nothing new to this world, people integrate it into anything and everything at this point.

There are countless magical disciplines, different theories as to how it works and such, but fundamentally there are three basic rules to how magic functions.
1: The law of non-linear conservation: Magic does not appear to conserve in the as normal energy, it is not one-to-one, if small amount of energy is injected more energy is gotten out. Thus, if the smallest unit of magic is injected into the world, that being a pico-hym, more than a pH will be gotten out, with proper ampiliciation this can have a gain of near 300%. But when the maximum magical energy that known species can create is injected into the world, which is known as a a kGallen, kG, would only yeild around 50% output. Thus the more powerful a spell the evenmore magical energy it will need

2: Magic is deeply associated with the ethereal plane, the dreaming plane, or the outer realms, it is a connection between the realm of thought and mind to the realm of matter and reality.

3: A mind makes magic easier, but it is not required: Just like some elements are more conductive to electricity so to are some more conductive and or conducive to allow magic to flow and if pure enough may spontaneously cause magic to occur
