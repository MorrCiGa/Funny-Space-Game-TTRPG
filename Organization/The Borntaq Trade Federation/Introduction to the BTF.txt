Space, the great unknow that we are compled to explore and uncover. We have been set on a voyage of discovery, to explore this expanse, not in the name of conquest or power, but for sciance, and to engage in new and challanging discourse. We will encounter many in our tavels across the stars, some much like our own, but others widly different, and it is our duty to guid them into a brighter future, when they are ready. That is our directive, to be the north star, a guiding light for those that wish to seek and thoughs that wish to discover.
