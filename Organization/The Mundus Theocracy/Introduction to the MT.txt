From the moment we found purchase amongst the stars we were preyed upon, and our heritage lost, replaced by false ideals from beings birthed from a different nature. When we no longer needed her, we lost our ties back to mother earth, her verdant green forests no more than wood, her rolling hills and towering mountains, her history laid out in rock and stone, nothing but resources to expand and explore. Her flesh is clean now, those leaches that did not even originate from her soil have been driven out, so too is sol, and her neighbors, and soon her neighbors neighbors until the leaches that clung to us when we were young are driven back to the lands that birthed them so we can return to ours.
