The Mundus Theocracy believes that Mundus, the native home of humans, is sacred, and that beings originating from other planets defile it, that one must exist within the ecosystem they evolved in to reach enlightenment. Thus, they are going on a galactic crusade to return each species to their home worlds.

The Mundus Theocracy was once the heart of the UAW, until in 1524 AD (after detonation) when John M. Smith lead a small militia of his deeply devoted druidic fanatics to detonate several implanted bio-weapons in the spaceports around Mundus, the home world of humans, at the same time John M. Smith transmitted messages to the populus using a psychedelic concoction of several naturally occurring flora and fauna, the message he transmitted is seen in the introduction of the MT. Mundus was cut off from all outside aid until 1528 AD when Juan M. Herrero, the apparent successor to John M. Smith, began liberating the rest of sol, the solar system in which Mundus resides.
