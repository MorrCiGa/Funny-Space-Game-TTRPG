We don’t hold some lofty idealistic perspective of this universe, we know how it works, we know that there are wolves and sheep, those that can be bought and those that can buy. We have seen the consequences of having morals, the bodies that doing the right thing, or the wrong, brings. We have seen the true shape of these morals too, and that shape is a coin, one side for the intentions and the other for the actions. We choose another path, why let a coin you can’t hold control you when you could let one you can hold do the same. 

Calling us a singularity, a single government, would be a stretch, for when we have different goals we are, but when we have the same goal, we are unified. That might seem disordered, but it turns out that with enough money thrown around people get on the same side rather fast
