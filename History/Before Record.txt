Far before the detonation, even before most of the sentient species are recognizable, there were their predecessors. The predecessors where the Kuminids, the Kashinites, the Bur'Throminids, and the Ophidinites, these four species existed in the galaxy far before, their empires stretching to the edges of space and beyond, but then something happened, and these powerful empires fell. Some scholars theorize that something devastating must have happened to throw these people so far back from where they once were.  In reality, this fall was nothing but expected to those in power at the time, for all four progenitor species where a form of cattle to the previous “tenant” (An extra planer being which has control over this realm), and thus, for the Kuminids, where probably no more than the most common ancestors between humans and neanderthals, maybe nearing homoerectus except they had spaceships. Thus, when the tenant was removed, the progenitors could no longer maintain their infrastructure nor their vehicles, and thus settled down. After some time they adapted to their new homes, and their physical forms changed, however it can still be seen that there or distinct social bedrock that is shared inside each of the diaspora.
