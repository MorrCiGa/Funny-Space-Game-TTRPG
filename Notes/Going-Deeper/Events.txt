The timeline was re-written twice, something has noticed

Gorhor Windbelt was noticed by the Bureau of Magical Supervision as a wizard possibly practicing unsanctioned time magic due to multiple disturbances in the Nebulorb, no action was taken due to a hefty donation to the bureau from Underhill Inc.

Bramock Twilightstone was promoted to the rank of Pick master and deacon of the deep, due to his performance in re-activating the plant and just being a cool dude,he had to pay for his regalia.

Underhill Inc gained no new info about The Staut Heart CO, and Bessel United gained info about both, it now bought two properties, Harnix 7 minings to manufactoring, and A66574Bx training to farming, from the Staut Heart Co, which were under performing until Bessel stepped in

After suffering severe injuries in the line of duty, Vyce Iraa petitioned management for automapping technologies and maybe for some better armor for their miners, they begrudgingly agreed, Vyce was moved to DR (dwarf resources) shortly after, they are now the first and only DR employ of the Stout heart corporation. DR's main job is mainly "health insurance"

Bee Hapi was moved to the ore identification unit of the Stout Heart Corporation where their skill for astrology and prospecting was put to good use, as they utilize the motion of celestial bodies and astrological skills to identify where the most mineral rich planets are. They run a small lumber mill in their free time.
